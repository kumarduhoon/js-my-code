// Javascript is provide a lot of in build method for mainpulate the string let discuss one by one 

// 1. anchor method is Deprecated so we are not going to discuss

 console.log(str1.at(5))
console.log(str1.at(-5))
// 3.  big() method is Deprecated so we are not going to discuss
// 4.  blink() method is Deprecated so we are not going to discuss
// 5.  bold() method is Deprecated so we are not going to discuss

// 6. charAt return the new string as value and it used to find the character based on the index

 console.log(str1.charAt(5))
 console.log( `char at ${str1.charAt(-5)}`)
 // note at() and charAt() both are work simliar but there is a differnece at is accept the negative value but charAt() not

// 7. charCodeAt() Every char have a unique code number for represent it so find the charcode of char based on the index

console.log(str1.charCodeAt(5))

// 8. codePointAt() which is used to return the unicode of the character
