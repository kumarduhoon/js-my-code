# Do javascipt really have a class
## Yes, javascript does have a class. This feature introduce in the ES6. Javascript is primarily prototype based programing language. its class are primarily syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. in other word , it provide more familair syntax  for developer coming from the class-based language like java, c++

### Note :- if we write something in class based code then code convert into prototype based then execute so if write code is class then compiler or interpertor take one more for execute that code 

### Object
- collection of properties and method

### why use OOP
#### Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a way of structuring software programs so that they are more modular, easier to understand, and easier to maintain. and we can use the re-use the code 

### Part of Object
- object literal
- constructor function
- prototype 
- instnance


### 4 pillars of the OOPs
- abstraction :- hide the details and only give the result,no matter what is going behind the secne
- encapsulation :- data and function are hide. hide data not able to access outside.
- inheritance (later) and
- polymorphism :- dual behavior of the same function 

#### this keyword is represent the current context of the object or any function
